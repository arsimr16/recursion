# recursion
This is a project I completed as part of the precourse work for [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com).

For this sprint I practiced recursion by reimplementing parts of the browser that involve recursion (obviously without using the things I was reimplementing or any other built-in shortcuts).

I reimplemented the following functions:
* getElementsByClassName
* stringify JSON
* parse JSON
